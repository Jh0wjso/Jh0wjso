Passionate about challenges, I am an engineer dedicated to continuous learning and problem-solving. My journey in tech began with a focus on electronic engineering, later transitioning to software engineering. I thrive on finding creative solutions to complex problems.

At Operately, I worked as a software engineer in a startup environment. During a recent two-month open-source project, I demonstrated my versatility with technologies such as Elixir, React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Amazon S3. My contributions spanned from interface design to backend system architecture, ensuring robust and scalable projects.

At CSG, a multinational company, I worked as a full-stack developer intern. I participated in the full software lifecycle, collaborating closely with senior developers and architects within a SCRUM framework. I contributed to innovative internal solutions like CSG People, CSG Track, CSG HUB, and CSG COB, using technologies such as C#, .NET, ASP.NET, PHP, ReactJS, TypeScript, and NextJS.

I believe in teamwork and the power of collective effort to achieve goals. My diverse experience has strengthened my technical skills and my ability to communicate effectively in an international environment. I am always eager to learn and grow in my field.
